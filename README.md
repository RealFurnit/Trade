For the bot to work, you need an Alpaca account with an API key and a private key.
You can hardcode this information into the code or make an .ENV file in the directory and put the data in the following way:
API_KEY="Your api key"
SECRET_KEY="Your secret key"

From here you can host it using your preferred hosting site or run it on your local machine.
Remember! If you want it to run continuously, use nohup in the terminal to make sure it runs all the time.
